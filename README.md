Traffic or traffic congestion could be reduced by bike/car pooling.
**This is primarily for Bike Pooling.** Many of the Bike riders/cars go empty with a sole driver. If some of them would offer lifts, within their respective source and destination, some of the traffic could be cleared. Because numerous people wait for bus at the location and more often than not, the buses run crowded, so we think that this kind of application would be helpful.
### Working Design:
* Service consumers and providers need to register and mention their details. 
* Provider could turn their location services ON while travelling which enables Consumers to visualise real time tracking of who is available in that area to give lifts in a given distance range. 
* Provider could have a sticker (similar to OLA Cabs) so that consumer can identify the vehicle easily. Identification of consumer by Provider ? - yet to think. 
* Consumers , once provider is identified, clicks on “Start Journey” once the journey is started and clicks on “End Journey” at the end of journey. 
* Emergency Contact person is always intimated of the travel details - Always share my details with contact . 
* Rating is asked. 
* Service Consumer and Provider wallet will be debited and credit accordingly using PayTM - and even ours !
